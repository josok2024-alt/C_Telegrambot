"""
Merges per-model votes into per-instrument consensus signals, applies the
agreement + confidence rules, ranks, and selects the top N to trade.

Rule recap (config-driven):
- An instrument qualifies if >= MIN_MODELS_AGREE models agree on direction,
  each of those agreeing votes individually >= MIN_CONFIDENCE.
- If REQUIRE_THREE_WHEN_AVAILABLE is True: among qualifying instruments,
  3/3-agreement ones are ranked strictly above 2/3-agreement ones,
  regardless of raw confidence average. This is a "prefer full consensus"
  policy, not a hard requirement — 2/3 instruments still qualify and can be
  traded if there aren't enough 3/3 ones to fill NUM_SIGNALS.
